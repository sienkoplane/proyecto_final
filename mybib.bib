abstract = {We study the suspensions of magnetic particles, the precursor state of magnetic gels and elastomers. We use magnetic particles with a permanent magnetization which is high enough to overcome thermal energy and low enough to guarantee a long live time of the sample. These particles form a space-filling structure at very low volume fractions (approximately 0.5 vol {\%}), which modifies the viscoelastic response of the matrix significantly. In confined geometry the particles form clusters of a size that depends on the sample thickness. Even small external fields induce a strong anisotropy in the mechanical and optical properties of the suspension. The action of the applied magnetic field induces a gel-like response in one direction but leaves the other directions liquidlike. The viscosity is a very sensitive mechanical test for the anisotropy of the material. Light scattering data confirm our mechanical results.},

abstract = {For the first time, thermoreversible ferrogels (FG) by physical gelation of ferrofluids have been described. Finavestan A80B paraffin oil in a concentration range of the gelator KRATON G-1650 with C-gelator=3-10 wt.-{\%}, was used to obtain stable and homogeneous FGs. TEM micrographs revealed that the magnetite particles, are preferably located in the 'free' paraffin phase between micellar domains of the gelator. So, the magnetite nanoparticles make visible a negative' picture of the structure of the micellar domains of the gel, which is observed in the pure gel as a 'positive' image. The mean diameter of the polystyrene cores is (d) over bar = 17 nm, and that of the magnetite particles is (d) over bar =7 nm.},

abstract = {Rheology is, by common consent, a difficult subject and some of the theoretical components are often viewed as being of prohibitive complexity by scientists without a strong mathematical background. There are also the difficulties inherent in any multidisciplinary science like rheology for those with a specific training. Therefore, newcomers to the field are sometimes discouraged, and for them the existing texts on the subject - some of which are outstanding - are of limited assistance because of their depth of detail and highly mathematical nature. This book introduces the subject of rheology in terms understandable to non-experts and describes the application of rheological principles to many industrial products and processes. It provides a simple but authoritative guide which shows clearly how mathematics, physics and chemistry have contributed to the development of rheology. The generic features of all liquid-like materials are summarised, i.e. viscosity, linear viscoelasticity, normal stresses and extensional viscosity. Particular systems are then discussed, i.e. polymeric liquids and suspensions. The final chapter gives an outline of the theoretical advances which have been made. Consistent notation and nomenclature have been used throughout the book, and the key textbooks and publications which will enable the reader to follow up particular topics are listed.},

The desired kinetics, duration, and rate of solute release from hydrogels are limited to specific conditions, such as hydrogel properties, amount of incorporated drug, drug solubility, and drug--polymer interactions. This review summarizes the compositional and structural effects of polymers on swelling, loading, and release and approaches to characterize solute release behavior in a dynamic state. A new approach is introduced to compensate drug effects (solubility and loading) with the release kinetics by varying the structure of heterogeneous polymers. Modulated or pulsatile drug delivery using functional hydrogels is a recent trend in hydrogel drug delivery.},

abstract = {Abstract A hydrogel is a 3-D network of polymer chains in which water is the dispersion medium. Hydrogels have found extensive applications in the biomedical field due to their resemblance to living tissues. Furthermore, hydrogels can be endowed with exceptional properties by addition of synthetic materials. For example, magnetic field-sensitive gels, called ferrogels, are obtained by embedding magnetic particles in the polymer network. Novel living tissues with unique magnetic field-sensitive properties were recently prepared by 3-D cell culture in biocompatible ferrogels. This paper critically reviews the most recent progress and perspectives in their synthesis, characterization and biocompatibility evaluation. Optimization of ferrogels for this novel application requires low-density, strongly magnetic, multi-domain particles. Interestingly, the rheological properties of the resulting ferrogels in the absence of field were largely enhanced with respect to nonmagnetic hydrogels, which can only be explained by the additional cross-linking imparted by the embedded magnetic particles. Remarkably, rheological measurements under an applied magnetic field demonstrated that ferrogels presented reversibly tunable mechanical properties, which constitutes a unique advantage with respect to nonmagnetic hydrogels. In vivo evaluation of ferrogels showed good biocompatibility, with only some local inflammatory response, and no particle migration or damage to distant organs. },

abstract = {The inclusion of magnetic nanoparticles into biopolymer matrixes enables the preparation of magnetic field-responsive engineered tissues. Here we describe a synthetic route to prepare biocompatible core-shell nanostructures consisting of a polymeric core and a magnetic shell{\{},{\}} which are used for this purpose. We show that using a core-shell architecture is doubly advantageous. First{\{},{\}} gravitational settling for core-shell nanocomposites is slower because of the reduction of the composite average density connected to the light polymer core. Second{\{},{\}} the magnetic response of core-shell nanocomposites can be tuned by changing the thickness of the magnetic layer. The incorporation of the composites into biopolymer hydrogels containing cells results in magnetic field-responsive engineered tissues whose mechanical properties can be controlled by external magnetic forces. Indeed{\{},{\}} we obtain a significant increase of the viscoelastic moduli of the engineered tissues when exposed to an external magnetic field. Because the composites are functionalized with polyethylene glycol{\{},{\}} the prepared bio-artificial tissue-like constructs also display excellent ex vivo cell viability and proliferation. When implanted in vivo{\{},{\}} the engineered tissues show good biocompatibility and outstanding interaction with the host tissue. Actually{\{},{\}} they only cause a localized transitory inflammatory reaction at the implantation site{\{},{\}} without any effect on other organs. Altogether{\{},{\}} our results suggest that the inclusion of magnetic core-shell nanocomposites into biomaterials would enable tissue engineering of artificial substitutes whose mechanical properties could be tuned to match those of the potential target tissue. In a wider perspective{\{},{\}} the good biocompatibility and magnetic behavior of the composites could be beneficial for many other applications.},

abstract = {In biomedicine, magnetic nanoparticles provide some attractive possibilities because they possess peculiar physical properties that permit their use in a wide range of applications. The concept of magnetic guidance basically spans from drug delivery and hyperthermia treatment of tumours, to tissue engineering, such as magneto-mechanical stimulation/activation of cell constructs and mechanosensitive ion channels, magnetic cell-seeding procedures, and controlled cell proliferation and differentiation. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to develop fully biodegradable and magnetic nanocomposite substrates for bone tissue engineering by embedding iron-doped hydroxyapatite (FeHA) nanoparticles in a poly($\epsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) matrix. X-ray diffraction analyses enabled the demonstration that the phase composition and crystallinity of the magnetic FeHA were not affected by the process used to develop the nanocomposite substrates. The mechanical characterization performed through small punch tests has evidenced that inclusion of 10 per cent by weight of FeHA would represent an effective reinforcement. The inclusion of nanoparticles also improves the hydrophilicity of the substrates as evidenced by the lower values of water contact angle in comparison with those of neat PCL. The results from magnetic measurements confirmed the superparamagnetic character of the nanocomposite substrates, indicated by a very low coercive field, a saturation magnetization strictly proportional to the FeHA content and a strong history dependence in temperature sweeps. Regarding the biological performances, confocal laser scanning microscopy and AlamarBlue assay have provided qualitative and quantitative information on human mesenchymal stem cell adhesion and viability/proliferation, respectively, whereas the obtained ALP/DNA values have shown the ability of the nanocomposite substrates to support osteogenic differentiation.},

Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and hydrophobic superparamagnetic magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) were combined together with different mass ratios in order to construct composite scaffolds using an electrospinning method for the first time.

In this context, magneto-thermoresponsive sunflower oil modified hyperbranched polyurethane (HBPU)/Fe 3 O 4 NCs with different wt.{\%} of magnetic nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4 ) were prepared by an in situ polymerization technique. Fourier-transform infrared, x-ray diffraction, vibrating sample magnetometer, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, thermal analysis and differential scanning calorimetric were used to analyze various physico-chemical structural attributes of the prepared NC. The results showed good interfacial interactions between HBPU and well-dispersed superparamagnetic Fe 3 O 4 , with an average diameter of 7.65 nm. The incorporation of Fe 3 O 4 in HBPU significantly improved the thermo-mechanical properties along with the shape-memory behavior, antibacterial activity, biocompatibility as well as biodegradability in comparison to the pristine system. The cytocompatibility of the degraded products of the NC was also verified by in vitro hemolytic activity and MTT assay. In addition, the in vivo biocompatibility and non-immunological behavior, as tested in Wistar rats after subcutaneous implantation, show promising signs for the NC to be used as antibacterial biomaterial for biomedical device and implant applications.},

abstract = {We report the preparation of novel magnetic field-responsive tissue substitutes based on biocompatible multi-domain magnetic particles dispersed in a fibrin-agarose biopolymer scaffold. We characterized our biomaterials with several experimental techniques. First we analyzed their microstructure and found that it was strongly affected by the presence of magnetic particles, especially when a magnetic field was applied at the start of polymer gelation. In these samples we observed parallel stripes consisting of closely packed fibers, separated by more isotropic net-like spaces. We then studied the viability of oral mucosa fibroblasts in the magnetic scaffolds and found no significant differences compared to positive control samples. Finally, we analyzed the magnetic and mechanical properties of the tissue substitutes. Differences in microstructural patterns of the tissue substitutes correlated with their macroscopic mechanical properties. We also found that the mechanical properties of our magnetic tissue substitutes could be reversibly tuned by noncontact magnetic forces. This unique advantage with respect to other biomaterials could be used to match the mechanical properties of the tissue substitutes to those of potential target tissues in tissue engineering applications.},
